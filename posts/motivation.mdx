I was blown away, when I got my first serious practice amp–a Blackstar ID:Core 40. Out-of-the-box it came with five distinct voices from Clean to Crunch with some nice overdrive-options in between. I spent countless hours twisting the tone knobs and flipping through presets in search of the "perfect" distortion sound. Every adjustment yielded something new, but I rarely landed exactly on the sound I imagined in my head.

All this experimenting sparked my curiosity. And as a mechanical engineering student, I knew there was more to learn beyond the amp's interface. I've seen firsthand how minor tweaks in mechanical systems can transform performance, and the same principle applies in electronics. By building my own distortion circuit, I could tweak the components of the system and their connections to cract the exact tone I had been chasing.

This series will be a guided tour through the design of the pedal. We'll look at each stage of the signal chain and discuss how it works and which design choices have been made. You'll hear how assymetrical versus symmetrical diode arrangements influence harmonic content, see waveform snapshots at different points in the circuit, and compare frequency-response curves of different tone-stack configurations. Think of it as an engineer's tour of the circuit: audio demos, oscilloscope plots, and annotated schematics that explain the "why" behind every sonic choice.

What is a distortion Pedal?
===========================
In 1964, Dave Davies of The Kinks famously slit the cone of his speaker cabinet with a razor blade to rough up its edges&mdash;thus creating the beloved tone on <a
